- name: Amadeus Get Cars Search Airport
  description: "With this API you can find out the price and type of car, for all
    car rental providers, near a specified airport.\n\nYou can quickly see the locations
    of car providers near a given airport, and what cars are available to rent, and
    at what prices. This API is based on our car pricing service that gets live availability
    from car providers, and is used to power a variety of airline and travel agency
    websites.\n           \nResults are validated from car providers, and thus response
    times may take up to 10 seconds (response times are typically about 5s), and the
    number of concurrent calls is throttled per user to avoid flooding our provider's
    systems. However, this means the final result is guaranteed to be live and accurate.\n\nThe
    configuration of this API allows search for car rentals in the rental location
    where the car is picked up (at the start of the rental), is the same as the one
    where it will be dropped off."
