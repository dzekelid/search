  description: "Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.\n
    \nThis method is intentionally quite limited. For more general searching, you
    should use a proper internet search engine restricted to the domain of the site
    in question.\n \nAt least one of tagged or intitle must be set on this method.
    nottagged is only used if tagged is also set, for performance reasons.\n \ntagged
    and nottagged are semi-colon delimited list of tags. At least 1 tag in tagged
    will be on each returned question if it is passed, making it the OR equivalent
    of the AND version of tagged on /questions.\n \nThe sorts accepted by this method
    operate on the follow fields of the question object:\n - activity - last_activity_date\n
    - creation - creation_date\n - votes - score\n - relevance - matches the relevance
    tab on the site itself Does not accept min or max\n  activity is the default sort.\n
    \n It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate,
    and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list of questions."
