name: Wolfram|Alpha
description: Wolfram Research is building a computational knowledge engine called
  Wolfram|Alpha for the web to be launched in May 2009. The product will contain data
  in various nbsp;fields including physical sciences, technology, geography, weather,
  cooking, business, music, etc. in order to provide answers to questions that users
  input. Its language interface will accommodate variations in how users frame their
  questions, such as the use of abbreviations. Wolfram Alpharsquo;s vision is to create
  a system which can do for formal knowledge (heuristics, algorithms, rules, methods,
  theorems, etc.) what search engines like Google have done for informal knowledge,
  such as text and documents.
